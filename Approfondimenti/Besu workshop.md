# Besu

Besu, an LF Decentralized Trust project, is an open-source Ethereum client developed under the Apache 2.0 license and written in Java. In this workshop, you will learn the core concepts of Besu’s features and how to operate and manage a private network. Through four hands-on exercises, you will gain practical experience in deploying, updating, using, and monitoring a private Besu network.

The primary goal of this workshop is to provide a comprehensive understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of Besu. It is designed for individuals familiar with blockchain technology and the Ethereum protocol. If you are looking for a solid starting point to become Certified Besu Professionals, this free workshop should be on your calendar.
