# Non-functional requirements

"In systems engineering and requirements engineering, a non-functional requirement (NFR) is a requirement that specifies criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviours
....The plan for implementing non-functional requirements is detailed in the system architecture, because they are usually architecturally significant requirements"
