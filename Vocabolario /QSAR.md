# QSAR

Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) is
a computational method that uses statistical and mathematical techniques to establish relationships between a chemical compound's molecular structure and its biological or chemical activity, such as potency, toxicity, or binding affinity. By correlating structural features with observed activities, QSAR models can predict the properties of new, untested molecules, aiding in drug discovery, lead optimization, virtual screening, and chemical hazard assessment, which can reduce the costs, time, and animal testing required for traditional experimental methods. 
How QSAR Works

    Data Collection: A dataset of compounds with known chemical structures and associated biological activities is collected.
    Descriptor Calculation: Structural and physical-chemical properties of these compounds are converted into numerical descriptors.
    Model Development: Statistical and mathematical methods are used to find correlations between these descriptors and the observed biological activities.
    Prediction: The established model can then predict the activity or properties of new compounds based solely on their structures.
