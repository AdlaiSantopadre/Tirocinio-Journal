# Security

Security is freedom from those conditions that may lead to loss of assets (anything of value) with undesired consequences (Ross, Winstead, & McEvilley 2022). Systems Security specifically is concerned with systems delivering capability (an asset) with intended and only intended behaviors and outcomes (no unacceptable consequences such as loss of asset integrity) in contested operational environments (cyberspace or physical).
